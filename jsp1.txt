JSP
====
JSP stands for Java Server Pages.

JSP is a dynamic web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

JSP is used for presentation layer/logic.


Limitations with Servlets
==========================
> To work with servlets strong java knowledge is required.

> It is not suitable for non-java programmers.

> It does not give any implicit oject.
  (Object which can be used directly without any configuration is called implicit object)

> Configuration of each servlet program in web.xml file is mandatory.

> Handling exceptions are mandatory.

> We can't maintain HTML code and java code seperately.

To overcome this limitations Sun Micro System introduced JSP.


Advantages of JSP 
==================
> To work with JSP strong java knowledge is not required.

> It is suitable for java and non-java programmers.

> It gives 9 implicit objects.

> Configuration of jsp program in web.xml file is not mandatory.

> Handling exceptions are optional.

> We can maintain HTML code and Java code seperately.

> It supports tag based language.

> It allows us to work with custom tags.

> It gives all the features of servlets.

First web application development having JSP as dynamic web resource program

Deployment Directory structure
-----------------------------
JspApp1
|
|---Java Resources
|
|---Web Content
	|
	|---ABC.jsp
	|
	|---WEB-INF
		|
		|----web.xml 
Note:
-----
In above application we need to add "servlet-api.jar" file in project build path.

Servlet container will execute servlet program.
JSP container will execute jsp program.
But to execute JSP program jsp container will take the support of servlet container. 


ABC.jsp
-------
<center>
	<h1>
		Current Date and Time : <br>
		
		<%
			java.util.Date d=new java.util.Date();
			out.println(d);
		%>
	</h1>
</center>

web.xml
-------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd" id="WebApp_ID" version="3.0">
  
  <welcome-file-list>
  	<welcome-file>ABC.jsp</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>
  
</web-app>

Note:
-----
	To see the output in JSP we need to replace ecj-4.2.2.jar file in Tomcat/lib folder.
	ex:
